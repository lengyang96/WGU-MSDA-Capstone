    "This analysis uses patient medical conditions and a k-NN method to predict whether patients would be later readmitted to hospitals. Patient care aims to reduce hospital visits, ensuring the best care possible is given on the initial visit. As such, this analysis would assist the business, when accounting for existing medical conditions, in structuring care plans to reduce further readmissions."

    "The k-NN method labels new data by looking at the nearest, surrounding labeled data in a feature space. The \"k\" in the k-NN method determines how many of the closest neighbors to use as a decision metric and then labels the new data based on the majority of those closest neighbors, like in a majority poll. Additionally, to determine which neighbors are closest, the method calculates the distance between the unlabeled data point and all other data points using a distance metric such as Euclidean distance, which measures a straight line between the points (IBM, 2021). Besides Euclidean distance, other distance metrics, such as Manhattan, Minkowski, Hamming distance, and others, can be used. Different combinations of the number of neighbors and distance metrics can be tested to select the combination that best predicts the unlabeled data. For this analysis a testing set will be used that acts as out-of-sample data. The model will use the data in this set to look at already known and labeled data points and then label the testing data according to how the model was trained. The expected outcome is to have test data classified based on their nearest neighbors with at least a model accuracy of 95%."

    "One of the central assumptions of the k-NN method is that the data exists in a feature space that can be measured by distance metrics such as Euclidean or Manhattan distances (Vishalmendekarhere, 2021). This is core to how k-NN functions because the method uses these calculated distances in the existing feature space to label new data based on a select number of nearest labeled data. In other words, labeled data points close to the new data point can be said to be similar, so the new data takes on the same label as those data points. Without this assumption, the k-NN method would fail to function correctly."

    "The number of neighbors used in the k-NN model sets the decision boundary for labeling unseen data, so a proper \"k\" value must be selected. Many techniques are used to determine the optimal number of neighbors, but the one used here is simple. K was decided using the square root of N observations (Bohara, 2023). Since the model is fitted on 80% of the data used for training, this proportion was used for the calculation. Taking the square root of 80% of the data, or 8000 observations, results in a value of about 89. This value represented the number of neighbors used in the model. As of this writing, the model uses default hyperparameters of uniform weights and the Minkowski distance metric.\n",

    "From the confusion matrix output, there were 1261 true negatives, one true positive, 733 false negatives, and five false positives. This resulted in about 1262 out of 2000 correct predictions, or a testing accuracy of 63.1%. The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve was also plotted to represent a visual of the model's performance. An ideal curve represents one where the curve is as close to the top left of the graph as possible, whereas a curve close to the dotted line indicates poor performance (GeeksforGeeks, 2024). The curve on top of the dotted line indicates that the model performs very poorly. This implication can be further evaluated by taking the area under the curve (AUC). The AUC score was calculated to be 0.49, indicating that the model performs no better than random guessing (GeeksforGeeks, 2024)."

    "The accuracy can be described as all correct predictions over the total number of predictions. As previously calculated, the model had a testing accuracy of about 63.1%. Additionally, the training accuracy was also calculated to determine if there was any overfitting. The training accuracy was 63.3%, slightly higher than the testing accuracy. Both accuracies being similar indicates that there was likely no overfitting involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the precision of predicting hospital readmissions can also be looked at. The precision measures how often a model's positive predictions are correct. Precision can be calculated by looking at the true positives over all predicted positive values. In this case, the precision is 1 out of 6, or 16.6%. With such a poor precision score, the model cannot reliably predict readmitted patients.\n",
    "\n",
    "The area under the curve (AUC) score provides insight into a classification model's performance, with a score of 0.5 indicating a model as good as random guessing and a score of 1 indicating perfect classification ability (GeeksforGeeks, 2024). Earlier calculations resulted in an AUC score of about 0.49. This result suggests that the model performs rather poorly. It could be said that the model's predictions are as good as random guesses."

    "This analysis aimed to reliably predict patient readmissions using existing medical conditions and a k-NN classification model. It was expected that the model would reliably label new data with an accuracy of 95%. This resulted in a testing accuracy of 63.1%, much lower than expected. As such, the model could not reliably predict readmissions based on medical conditions alone. This could implicate that other factors in the dataset may influence hospital readmissions as well. Given a calculated AUC score of 0.49, the model is as good as random chance, thus making for an unreliable one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the model's current poor performance, it could be further improved. Since no hyperparameter tuning was performed in this analysis, such tuning could improve model performance. Cross-validation could be used to determine the combination of hyperparameters that produce the highest model accuracy."

    "One of the more prominent limitations in this analysis involves the imbalance in hospital readmission rates. Of all observations in the data, only about 36.7% of patients were readmitted. This imbalance may have led the model to mislabel the less common readmission class. This can be further implicated by the confusion matrix results of the testing set, where there were 733 false negatives and only one true positive. Most predictions were wrongly classified as no readmission when there was readmission."

    "Based on the results of this analysis, with poor accuracy and AUC scores, this k-NN classification model should not be used to predict whether new patients are at risk of hospital readmission. This could indicate that patient medical conditions alone are insufficient to determine readmissions. Thus, using another technique instead to select predictors that would significantly impact readmission rates would be recommended. Additionally, cross-validation techniques should be employed for hyperparameter tuning to choose the combination that yields the best score and for a better estimate of model evaluation, as a single use of a train-test-split method can produce a high-variance estimate of model accuracy."
