This portfolio culminates my coursework in Western Governors University's Master of Science in Data Analytics (MSDA) program. The program consisted of 11 courses covering a wide range of topics related to the data analytics life cycle, as defined by WGU: Business Understanding, Data Acquisition, Data Cleaning, Data Exploration, Predictive Modeling, Data Mining/Machine Learning, and Reporting and Visualization.


| Course  | Description  |  Projects |
|---|---|---|
| D204: The Data Analytics Journey  | This course covered topics such as the data analytics life cycle, organizational needs, project planning, and an introduction to analytical tools and techniques.  | No project was required for this course. Instead, a final exam was used to assess the student's knowledge of the relevant topics.  |  
| D205: Data Acquisition  | This course introduced topics related to relational databases and builds proficiency in SQL and database management.  | The project focused on importing an external data file into an existing database using PostgreSQL and pgAdmin. The student then wrote a query to answer a research question of interest.  |   
| D206: Data Cleaning  | This course covered data preparation and cleaning. Topics included exploring the data and applying proper techniques to handle missing data and outliers.  | The project required the student to clean a provided dataset using the techniques learned in the course. A key focus of the project was providing detailed justifications for how the data was cleaned.  | 
| D207: Exploratory Data Analysis  | The course covered exploring data using statistical techniques, including measures of central tendency. It also included hypothesis testing and common techniques associated with it.  | The project required the student to perform exploratory analysis and answer a research question using one of the hypothesis testing methods learned in the course.  | 
| D208: Predictive Modeling  | The course focused on two common statistical regression modeling techniques: linear regression and logistic regression. The student gained an understanding of their uses and limitations.  | There were two projects in the course. The first involved using a linear regression model to answer a research question. The second project was similar, but utilized a logistic regression technique.  | 
| D209: Data Mining I  | This course expanded on predictive modeling by introducing additional techniques for regression and classification, including decision trees, random forests, lasso and ridge regression, and k-NN and Naive Bayes classification.  | There were two projects in this course. The first involved using a classification technique to answer a research question. The second project was similar, but focused on the use of the regression techniques covered.  | 
| D210: Representation & Reporting  | This course developed the student's skills in communicating and reporting analytical results to relevant audiences.  | The project required the student to import data files into Tableau and create a dashboard showcasing business insights, which would then be presented to relevant business stakeholders. Additionally, a report was written detailing the analytical process and results, with more in-depth information tailored to an audience of data analyst peers.  | 
| D211: Advanced Data Acquisition  | This course built on the previous course on reporting and expanded on data acquisition from various sources. Additionally, advanced SQL topics were introduced to further develop the student's mastery of the language.  | The project required the student to load an external data file into an existing SQL database and create a connection to Tableau to streamline the data pipeline process. Once completed, the student would generate business insights and present them to the intended audience.  | 
| D212: Data Mining II  | This course built on previous modeling techniques and introduced unsupervised machine learning methods, such as clustering, principal component analysis (PCA), and market basket analysis.  | There were three projects, each focusing on a specific technique: hierarchical or k-means clustering, PCA, and market basket analysis.  | 
| D213: Advanced Data Analysis  | This course provided an introduction to advanced analytical techniques, such as time series analysis and deep learning.  | There were two projects in this course. The first focused on time series analysis, while the second focused on sentiment analysis using NLP and neural networks.  | 
| D214: Data Analytics Capstone  | This course allowed the student to apply the knowledge and techniques developed throughout the program. The capstone project challenged the student's knowledge and skills, integrating concepts from the entire program into one final project.  | The capstone involved several steps. The first required the student to source an external dataset, which had to be approved before any analysis could begin. The second step involved writing a detailed report of the analytical process, tailored for an audience of analytical peers. The final step was an executive summary report intended for business stakeholders.  |
