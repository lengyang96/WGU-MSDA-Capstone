This is a portfolio culminating my coursework of Western Governors University's Master's of Science in Data Analytics (MSDA). The program consisted of 11 courses covering a multitude of topics regarding the data analytics life cycle, as defined by WGU: Business Understanding, Data Acquisition, Data Cleaning, Data Exploration, Predictive Modeling, Data Mining/ML, and Reporting and Visualization. 


| Course  | Description  |  Projects |
|---|---|---|
| D204: The Data Analytics Journey  | This course covered topics such as the data analytics life cycle, organizational needs, project planning, and an introduction to analytical tools and techniques.  | No project was required for this course. Instead, a final exam was used to test the student's knowledge of the relevant topics.  |  
| D205: Data Acquisition  | This course introduces the topics revolving around relational databases and builds proficiency around SQL and database management.  | The project focused on importing an external data file into an existing database using PostgresSQL and pgAdmin. The student would then write a query to answer a research question of interest.  |   
| D206: Data Cleaning  | This course addresses data preparation and cleaning. Topics included exploring the data and proper techniques to handle missing data as well as outliers.  | The project required the student to clean a provided dataset using the techniques learned in the course. A focus of this project involved detailed justifications for how the data was cleaned.  | 
| D207: Exploratory Data Analysis  | The course covers exploring the data through the use of statistical techniques including the measures of central tendency. Also covered was hypothesis testing and some common techniques of this testing.  | The project required the student to perform exploratory analysis and answer a research question of interest using one of the hypothesis testing methods learned in the course.  | 
| D208: Predictive Modeling  |   |   | 
| D209: Data Mining I  |   |   | 
| D210: Representation & Reporting  |   |   | 
| D211: Advanced Data Acquisition  |   |   | 
| D212: Data Mining II  |   |   | 
| D213: Advanced Data Analysis  |   |   | 
| D214: MS Data Analytics Capstone  |   |   |
